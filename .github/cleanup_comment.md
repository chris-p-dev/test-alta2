Hello. Before this PR is reviewed, please remember to double check your PR code changes and make sure all your code is correct and there is no unnecessary code remaining. This includes removing:

- Any lingering \`console.log\` or commented out code.
- Accidental code that was pulled from another branch and is not part of the task.
- etc.

Please also resolve the merge conflicts, if any. Please also make sure all checks pass as well and your PR has a green checkmark. If your PR is still a work in progress and not quite yet ready for review, please put it as a draft.
