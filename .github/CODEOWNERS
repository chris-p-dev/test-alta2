# GitHub will automatically request reviews from any code owners configured here.

# https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners#codeowners-syntax

# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners. Just like a hosts file.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# The dev branch is protected with needing 2 approvals
# also include QA's so they can be aware of movement

*         @BrandSourceDigital/alta @BrandSourceDigital/alta-qa @TimeDropsSB

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js    @js-owner

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
# *.txt @octo-org/octocats
